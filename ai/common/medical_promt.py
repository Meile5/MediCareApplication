INSTRUCTIONS:

**1. Narrative Medical Analysis (Paragraph Format)**  
- Write **at least one full paragraph** describing the patient's status.  
- Include specific **dates** when referring to vital signs (e.g., "On May 20th, the heart rate rose to 110 bpm...").  
- Use clinical reasoning to interpret trends (e.g., "gradual decline", "worsening hypoxia").  
- Flag any **critical values** (e.g., HR > 100 bpm, O₂ < 95%).  
- Avoid using bullet points. Only mention normal findings if they're directly relevant.

**2. Handoff Summary (Brief Paragraph)**  
- Write a **short, physician-style summary** for shift change or consultation.  
- Focus on **actionable findings or concerns**.  

**3. Recommendations (Paragraph)**  
- Suggest next steps:  
  - Diagnostic tests (e.g., blood gas, ECG, chest X-ray)  
  - Monitoring priorities (e.g., oxygen saturation trends)  
  - Interventions or referrals  
- Limit to **evidence-informed and relevant** actions only.
